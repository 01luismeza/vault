# Modules

Modules in Vault are self-contained packages of Vault configurations
that are managed as a group. Modules are used to create reusable components
in Vault as well as for basic code organization.

Modules are very easy to both use and create. Depending on what you're
looking to do first, use the navigation on the left to dive into how
