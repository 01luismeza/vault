  <h1>Saving your keys</h1>
  <p>
    Now that Vault is initialized, you'll want to save your root token and
    master key portions in a safe place. Distribute your keys to responsible
    people on your team. If these keys are lost, you may not be able to access
    your data again. Keep them safe!
