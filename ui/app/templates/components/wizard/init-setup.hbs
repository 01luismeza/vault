  <h1>Setting up your master keys</h1>
  <p>
    This is the very first step of setting
    a Vault server. Vault comes with an important
    security feature called "seal", which lets you
    shut down and secure your Vault installation if
    there is a security breach. This is the default
    state of Vault, so it is currently sealed since
    it was just installed. To unseal the vault, you will
    need to provide the key(s) that you generate here.
