    Now we will provide the {{pluralize componentState.threshold 'key'}} that
    you copied or downloaded to unseal the vault so that we can get started
    using it. You'll need {{pluralize componentState.threshold 'key'}} total,
    and {{#with (pluralize componentState.progress 'key' without-count=true) as |word|}}
    {{if (eq word 'key')
      (concat componentState.progress " " word " has ")
      (concat componentState.progress " " word " have ")
      }}
    {{/with}} already been provided.
    Please provide
    {{pluralize (dec componentState.progress componentState.threshold) 'more key'}} to unseal.
